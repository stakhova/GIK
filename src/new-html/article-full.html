              <p>GIK Acoustics not only offers quality, patented, Eco-friendly products but we also provide customers with custom acoustical advice as well as helpful educational articles. We take a holistic approach in helping customers understand the acoustical issues in their space and then present a practical approach to addressing the issues.</p>

              <h2>How to choose an acoustic panel?</h2>
              <p>Choose the level of absorption: 50mm thick, 100mm thick, or 150mm thick panels</p>
              <p>The depth or thickness of the panels depends on the amount of low-frequency absorption desired. The thickness of the panel dictates the lower limit of absorption. As thickness increases, the amount of low frequency absorption increases as well. The thicker the panel, the greater the absorption.</p>

              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>The depth or thickness of the panels depends on the amount of low-frequency absorption desired. The thickness of the panel dictates the lower limit of absorption. As thickness increases, the amount of low frequency absorption increases as well. The thicker the panel, the greater the absorption.</p>
              <br><br>
              <h2>Information</h2>
              <p>The Impression Series is ideal for creating an even balance of low end absorption without losing high frequency presence. The Impression Series features beautifully decorative, semi-reflective rigid plates attached to absorptive acoustic panels and bass traps. The rigid plate not only gives the panel a stylish appearance but also helps reflect/scatter high frequency content in your room giving the proper balance needed.</p>
              <p>Half the battle when treating small rooms is to obtain a smooth bass response without over-dampening the high-end. A room filled with full range absorptive panels will absorb too much of the high frequency content, resulting in a dull and muddy room response. Finding an even balance of low end absorption while maintaining the high-end will yield maximized results.</p>
              <p>The Impression Series not only performs well in critical listening environments (audio rooms or studios) but is a perfect fit for any room in your home. They are also ideal for public places where the room acoustics interfere with your enjoyment. It could be your workplace or a local restaurant where speech intelligibility is compromised or the room has too much reverberation and is too loud. Whatever the space – living room, an office conference room, restaurant dining room, meeting room, hotel lobby, house of worship, lecture hall, or school cafeteria – balancing room acoustics is vital.</p>
