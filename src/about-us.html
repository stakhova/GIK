                                            <p>Jonathan Wyman is a producer, mixer, and engineer who started his career at 19.

                                            <p>We sat down virtually with mixing engineer, Jonathan Wyman, whose work you may have heard at the top of the Billboard charts in 2020 with US chart-topping single from the band The Pretty Reckless, to discuss room acoustics and both the challenges and exciting changes that came with his recent transition from the traditional studio to the home studio.</p>
                                            <p>He gave us a glimpse into his fully GIK-designed home studio, and used our 3D modeling application to visualize the look and feel of the room. The results are stunning aesthetically and sonically.</p>

                                        <h3>Description</h3>
                                        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean euismod bibendum laoreet. Proin gravida dolor sit amet lacus accumsan et viverra justo commodo. Proin sodales pulvinar tempor. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.

                                        <h2>Information</h2>
                                        <p>The Impression Series is ideal for creating an even balance of low end absorption without losing high frequency presence. The Impression Series features beautifully decorative, semi-reflective rigid plates attached to absorptive acoustic panels and bass traps. The rigid plate not only gives the panel a stylish appearance but also helps reflect/scatter high frequency content in your room giving the proper balance needed.</p>
                                        <p>Half the battle when treating small rooms is to obtain a smooth bass response without over-dampening the high-end. A room filled with full range absorptive panels will absorb too much of the high frequency content, resulting in a dull and muddy room response. Finding an even balance of low end absorption while maintaining the high-end will yield maximized results.</p>
                                        <p>The Impression Series not only performs well in critical listening environments (audio rooms or studios) but is a perfect fit for any room in your home. They are also ideal for public places where the room acoustics interfere with your enjoyment. It could be your workplace or a local restaurant where speech intelligibility is compromised or the room has too much reverberation and is too loud. Whatever the space – living room, an office conference room, restaurant dining room, meeting room, hotel lobby, house of worship, lecture hall, or school cafeteria – balancing room acoustics is vital.</p>
                                        <p>The Impression Series panels are ideal to create balance and remove reverberance, AND the stylish patterns and size options deliver a beautiful visual statement to enhance any room.</p>
