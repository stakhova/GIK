            <p>Jonathan Wyman is a producer, mixer, and engineer who started his career at 19. Since then he’s gone on to produce and mix a wide variety of projects spanning multiple genres and has worked alongside professionals such as Tony Visconti, Matt Wallace, Randy Staub, and Brian Malouf.</p>
            <p>We sat down virtually with mixing engineer, Jonathan Wyman, whose work you may have heard at the top of the Billboard charts in 2020 with US chart-topping single from the band The Pretty Reckless, to discuss room acoustics and both the challenges and exciting changes that came with his recent transition from the traditional studio to the home studio.</p>
            <p>He gave us a glimpse into his fully GIK-designed home studio, and used our 3D modeling application to visualize the look and feel of the room. The results are stunning aesthetically and sonically.</p>
